                <p>During my employment at MyBond, I led a project where I liaised with the business to help facilitate the automation of payments. In collaboration with the Chief Technical Officer a decision was reached on the correct platform that would benefit the business, as such Zai was chosen. In an effort to effectively implement this platform into the business I took the initiative and researched and learnt the best uses of this product. I carried out discussions with the Head of Finance to help me gather the correct requirements to successfully implement this automation. As a final result I was able to achieve a 95% reduction of the workload for the Head of Finance required for this previous manual task</p>

My tasks are consistently completed ahead of time and I’m always ready to offer assistance when needed.
